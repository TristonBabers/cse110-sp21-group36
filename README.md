**Just a Reminder**, we have daily [Standup Meetings at this link](https://app.sup.today/dashboard?timePeriod=this_week), or on Slack, and it is required that group members fill them out to meet Agile standards.

### Assignments:
- We have decided to divide into 3 teams to start working on the website more efficently. Look at the team roles to see which team you are on, you should also be in a Slack chat with your teammates. We will be doing a meeting on either Monday or Sunday based on the When2Meet results.
- This will be useful for developing the Javascript files: [C4 Diagram - Bottom](https://github.com/cse110-sp21-group36/cse110-sp21-group36/blob/main/specs/brainstorm/C4%20Diagram%20Bottom%20Level.PNG)
