# Condensed Project Pitch Meeting Notes
- The oringinal meeting notes are [here](https://github.com/cse110-sp21-group36/cse110-sp21-group36/blob/main/admin/meetings/103122-Project-Pitch-Meeting.md), it just doesn't include the minimum viable product specs.

## Comments from Allison (T.A.)
* We should have a Minimum Viable Product Specification, so we have an idea of the bare minimum that needs to be completed.
* We should explore other Recipe Manager Apps to see ideas that worked well in their design and consider adding them to our own.
* We should consider a CI/CD build pipeline for the project. e.g. What tests will we run on the website's code? Will we verify the HTML using 3-rd Party site _____? etc.
* Consider splitting up the team into multiple groups for the Home Page, Viewing Page, and Editing Page so we could work more efficiently.

## (Updated) Minimum Viable Product Specifications:
* Website must load with 1< second.
* Be able to navigate between pages.
  * Must include the 3 pages:
    * App Home Page
    * Recipe Viewing Page
    * Recipe Editing Page
* Create, delete, update, delete recipes. (CRUD Requirement)
* Prompt user input to add to recipes: images and text.
* Associate recipes with certain labels to accommodate filtered searches (linked to sorting)
* Be able to sort recipes on the home page:
  * Usage of Button Labels to hide visibility of Recipes based on their attributes.
  * Usage of Search Bar to search for recipes by title.
* Search Option to only display recipes that match text search on the home page
* Accommodate the target browsers of Windows Edge, Firefox, and Google Chrome.
