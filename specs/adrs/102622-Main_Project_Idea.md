# Main Idea to Design Our Project Around

## Context and Problem Statement

Which application would fit best within a CRUD framework?
Which application could we feasibly create within a 5 week time frame?
What idea do most of the group members have some background knowledge in?

## Considered Options

* Cooking Recipe App - proposed by Miko
* Emotion Tracker App - proposed by Rappel
* Social Media Image Storing App - proposed by Triston

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** We've chosen to move ahead with the Cooking Recipe App during our previous Brainstorming Meeting on 10/23/22 for the following criteria:
    1) A cooking recipe app is very reasonable to build, and there are numerous examples of this kind of project.
    2) Everyone is at decently familiar with the use of a cooking recipe when preparing meals.
    3) This idea is very focused scope-wise, as we simply need to somehow store the recipes, either as text or images or both, and display them to our user. Furthermore, there is a lot of room to grow and add additional features if we have time.
