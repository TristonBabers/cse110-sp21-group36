# Break Into Teams of 3

## Context and Problem Statement

How best should we approach developing the website?
What means of organizing ourselves will allow the most team collaboration?

## Considered Options

* We could work individually on each of the issues posted on our gitHub project board
  * (i.e. One person can do the CSS of the home page, another person does the Javascript for the Recipe Editor, etc.)
* We split into 3 teams for HTML, JS, and CSS
  * More Group collaboration within the teams, each dedicated to strictly HTML development, CSS development and JS development.
* We split into 3 teams for each Web Page
  * One team will work on the home page's HTML, CSS, & JS, another will work on the Recipe Editor Pages's HTML, CSS, & JS.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** We've decided splitting into 3 teams for each Web Page will be the best because:
    1) Right now we need lots of collaboration and communication so individual tickets wouldn't accomplish those goals.
    2) Limiting a single team to just HTML, or just JavaScript would kind of create a tangled mess, where the JS can't change the HTML without ruining the work of the CSS team, etc.
    3) Working on each page individually will allow us more liberty in designing the pages, as the only thing they share is access to the Recipe objects, and a link to the other pages.
